## Using the Fate Chart

1. State a Question: Form a Yes/No question
2. Determine Odds: Estimate the odds of the question coming out "yes"
3. Determine Probability: Cross reference the odds with the current Chaos score to get your percentage chance of a "yes
4. Roll: Roll 1d100. If you roll within the percentage range, the answer is "YES". If you roll above, the answer is no. If you roll in the lower 1/5 of the range, then the answer is an exceptional "YES". If you roo in the upper 20% of the failure range, then the answer is an exceptional "NO"
5. Interpret the answer:Draw the most logical conclusion from the results. If this is not possible, then ask another question to clarify, returning to step 1.

Eidolon Drive works by creating a 'tunnel' using a technique similiar to https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-uncover-a-new-state-of-matter-hidden-in-the-quantum-world to tunnel through quantum manifolds (of which there are infinite layers, making it possible for an infinite number of ships to occupy a specific point in space). https://einstein.stanford.edu/SPACETIME/spacetime2.html suggests that areas where gravity is 'stretched' (like black holes, heavy stars, jovian bodies, super planets) do make it possible to create Eidolon-drive tunnels, the amount of energy needed to curve and stretch the spacetime manifold increases greatly.

This is why the Exodus Obelisk was discovered in orbit near Jupiter, less energy was required to charge up the Obelisk with it in the gravity well of Jupiter, the tunnel appears not unlike a funnel, requiring a ship to use sublight to maneuver into the swirling vortex, but while looking 'down the throat' of the vortex, it's completely two dimensional. Once in, the Eidolon drive continues to generate the charged field to hold the bubble open, and manipulating the manifold, to move through the quantum realm. Many ships can create the necessary manifold strength when in a massive gravity well, which is why gates have been created near solar masses and Jovian bodies. ship made vortices are less stable, which decreases potential distance traveled. And nothing on the range of the Exodus Obelisk that brought humanity to the Forge. Even the Primrose Primary gate has the ability to energize a 12Mau field and can send a ship theorectically 30 LY before the field de-stabilizes Advances in field geometries and faster computational algorithms will make it possible for a 50LY jump eventually, but safety of human lives in the Forge makes 10LY the furthest safe distance to date. Testing on longer jumps has been halted since the loss of the "Jason" experimental craft, with the loss of all hands and it's prototype AI. Bigger ships cannot transit as long, meaning that smaller ships can go farther, if they had enough power to continue to generate the field. We've found courier and trader vessels in the 200ton range have the best range overall at 10LY, while military vessels have been known to go beyond 10LY, the crew often must spend time dealing with the effects of the distance. 30LY means hi-sleep for crew, which requires preparation and shutting down systems. It is usually only done in emergencies, as sedatives for hi-sleep take time to synthesize for each crew member, and many crews do not want to leave the ship in the hands of the NavAI.

Smyth protocols enacted during pre-drive engagement have been quietly implemented to reduce stress on people and increase jump distances. Some spacers have seen after images of ships, even battles of unknown vessels and and events occur during long jumps. The use of sensory deprivation methods and 'dark ship' protocols in the past decade have reduced the number of occurrances, but some have mentioned hearing whispers or snippets of conversations. Since reports have been from people not regularly conducting travel through quantum space, these have largely been explained away as being hallucinations. 

SPOILER: The truth of the matter is that these are real. Perception of time in the quantum state varies rapidly. And people with sensitivity can 'see' different alternative realities (like the Flash seeing many multiple versions of the universe). some of these are close enough to be 'seen' or percieved. SOme people go mad, other are discounted, especially if someone mentions destructive or disastrous consequences. the duration of 'flight' for the eidolon drive
